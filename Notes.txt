Update notes
-------------- 1.2 ----------------
- Removed 'champion' from both add and remove commands
	- New commands: !aram add 
			!aram remove



------------ 1.1 -------------
- Added !aram add champion 
	- Adds a champion of your desired name to champs.txt
		- Example: !aram add champion Toscanni
	- Can use 'champ' instead of 'champion' in the command
	- Can only be used by users that have a role that provides them with permissions to kick other users. This can be changed.
- Added !aram remove champion
	- Removes a champion from champs.txt
		- Example: !aram remove champ Jayce   or   !aram remove champ Aurelion Sol
	- Can be used to remove Yuumi from the pool temporarily, just use !aram add champ to add her back when she's not cancer
	- Can only be used by users that have a role that provides them with permissions to kick other users. This can be changed.
- Added !aram list
	- Lists all champions in champs.txt
- Added a permission denied message, for users who attempt to use a command that they do not have sufficient permissions to use
- Changed !aram to pull from champs.txt

Planned 1.2 features
- Change all commands to accept shortened versions (!aram a c Yone) or (!aram r c Nami) should accept the lowest number of letters that keeps it unique
	- (!aram will still require full length)
- !aram help 
	- Should provide a list of commands available for that user. Most users will only be provided with !aram and !aram list currently
	- Admin users will be provided with the full list of commands
